This is an adaptation of lavallc's Maple port of the NeoPixel library for STM32Duino. It is not compatible with other boards at this time. We added "-ANDnXOR" to the file names so there won't be a conflict in your build environment. Hopefully we'll find time to pull in the latest Adafruit changes.


Adafruit NeoPixel library
=========================

Arduino library for controlling single-wire-based LED pixels and strip such as the [Adafruit 60 LED/meter Digital LED strip][strip], the [Adafruit FLORA RGB Smart Pixel][flora], the [Adafruit Breadboard-friendly RGB Smart Pixel][pixel], the [Adafruit NeoPixel Stick][stick], and the [Adafruit NeoPixel Shield][shield].

After downloading, rename folder to 'Adafruit_NeoPixel' and install in Arduino Libraries folder. Restart Arduino IDE, then open File->Sketchbook->Library->Adafruit_NeoPixel->strandtest sketch.
