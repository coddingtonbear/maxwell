  PCA9536 LIBRARY - I2C COMMUNICATION STATUS STRING EXAMPLE
  ---------------------------------------------------------

  INTRODUCTION
  ------------
  This sketch presents a minimal example of extending the PCA9536 Library to include an additional function
  for generating a printable I2C Communications Status string which may be useful, for example, during debugging sessions.

  As can be seen in the sketch below, implementation of this extended functionality only requires adding a single 'include'
  to the code, namely that of the relevant *.h file (PCA9536ComStr.h).
  
  Note that this functional extension does come at the cost of an increased memory usage, and therefore it seemed preferable to maintain it 
  as an optional add-on rather than include it in the core PCA9536 Library itself.

  This hookup can be used with the following sketch:

  PIN 1 (IO0) - Leave unconnected for the purpose of this sketch
  PIN 2 (IO1) - Leave unconnected for the purpose of this sketch
  PIN 3 (IO2) - Leave unconnected for the purpose of this sketch
  PIN 4 (GND) - Connect to Arduino GND
  PIN 5 (IO3) - Leave unconnected for the purpose of this sketch
  PIN 6 (SCL) - Connect to Arduino Pin A5 with a 2K2 (400MHz) or 10K (100MHz) pull-up resistor
  PIN 7 (SDA) - Connect to Arduino Pin A4 with a 2K2 (400MHz) or 10K (100MHz) pull-up resistor
  PIN 8 (VCC) - Connect to Arduino 5V output
  DECOUPING   - Connect a 0.1uF Ceramic Capacitor between the PCA9536's VCC & GND pins

  I2C ADDRESS
  -----------
  The PCA9536 has a single I2C address (factory hardwired):

    PART                DEVICE I2C ADDRESS         PART
   NUMBER           (BIN)     (HEX)     (DEC)     MARKING
  --------        --------    -----     -----     -------
  PCA9536D        01000001    0x41       65       PCA9536

  Note: The 'D' suffix of the Part Number denotes the SOIC-8 package
