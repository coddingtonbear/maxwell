/* 
  PCA9536 LIBRARY - BASIC DEVICE TESTING EXAMPLE
  ----------------------------------------------
  
  INTRODUCTION
  ------------
  This sketch offers a quick & simple code for testing that the PCA9536 is hooked-up and operating correctly.

  The sketch begins by searching for the PCA9536 on the I2C Bus. I then moves on to get the various Register data available from the device
  (Ambient Temperature, Limit, and Hysteresis). And finally, it verifies that the Alert functionality is working as it should (at least, 
  in default mode).
  
  INPORTANT: The current library depends on the Arduino IDE's native 'Wire' library for I2C communication between the Arduino (Master) and the PCA9536 (Slave).

               -------
        IO0 --| â€¢     |-- VCC
              |       |
        IO1 --|       |-- SDA

        GND --|       |-- IO3
               -------

  This hookup can be used with the following sketch:

  PIN 1 (IO0) - Connect LED (anode via appropriate series resistor to Arduino 5V output & cathode to PCA9536 Pin 1)
  PIN 2 (IO1) - Leave unconnected for the purpose of this sketch
  PIN 3 (IO2) - Leave unconnected for the purpose of this sketch
  PIN 4 (GND) - Connect to Arduino GND
  PIN 5 (IO3) - Leave unconnected for the purpose of this sketch
  PIN 6 (SCL) - Connect to Arduino Pin A5 with a 2K2 (400MHz) or 10K (100MHz) pull-up resistor
  PIN 7 (SDA) - Connect to Arduino Pin A4 with a 2K2 (400MHz) or 10K (100MHz) pull-up resistor
  PIN 8 (VCC) - Connect to Arduino 5V output
  DECOUPING   - Connect a 0.1uF Ceramic Capacitor between the PCA9536's VCC & GND pins

  I2C ADDRESS
  -----------
  The PCA9536 has a single I2C address (factory hardwired):

    PART                DEVICE I2C ADDRESS         PART
   NUMBER           (BIN)     (HEX)     (DEC)     MARKING
  --------        --------    -----     -----     -------
  PCA9536D        01000001    0x41       65       PCA9536

  Note: The 'D' suffix of the Part Number denotes the SOIC-8 package
